## Bot Setup

***Option 1.*** **Add my bot to your server (Short and Easy)**
``
    - For my visual learner:
        *Video going through the setup process*
            https://youtu.be/LiY_u0w5rWA
```
    1. *Copy and Paste this link into your browser to add the bot to a server:*
    https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1287923287816671293&permissions=275012332624&integration_type=0&scope=bot

    2. *Give permissions to the bot in a specific channel*

    3. *Create and give the 'bot controller' role to users that you want to be able to use the Bot Controller Commands*
```

***Option 2.*** **Create your own environment (Harder)**
```
    1. Download the files in the "One Server" Folder

    2. Update the IDs at the top to the corresponding IDs

    3. Decide where to run the code: either the cloud or a local server

    4. Run it

    - There's a lot more detailed steps I am not going to go through here, if you want to go this route (though not recommended), please message me on instagram @buchanan_roundnet

## How ELO Decay Works

- **Activity Tracking:** Each player has a `last_game` timestamp updated whenever they participate in a match.
- **Decay Start:** After 14 days of inactivity, a player's ELO starts decaying.
- **Daily Decay:** ELO decreases daily by a defined factor until the player becomes active again.

## Example Use Cases

1. **Joining the System:**
    - A user types `$join` and provides their custom name.
    - They are added to the ranking system with an initial ELO of 1000.

2. **Challenging Others:**
    - Challenge players with `$challenge`
    - You will be prompted with a series of questions, read and mention specific people for the question.

3. **Reporting Match Results:**
    - After a match, one player types `$results` then mention a user from the winning team.
    - The bot updates the ELO for both teams based on the match outcome.

4. **Checking Activity:**
    - A user types `$activity` to see how many days and hours remain until decay starts.

5. **Role Holder Override:**
    - The admin resets a playerâ€™s ELO using `$override`.
    - The admin removes a player using `$remove`.
    - The admin toggles challenges with `$pause` and `$resume`.
